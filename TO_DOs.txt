Ian: 
- Explore prediction and/or ML econometric techniques with attributes + Carp Manning data

George:
- Hone predictive models of judge ideology - Done (to a reasonable degree)
- Create simple table showing training/test MSE's of all four prediction methods - Done 
- (Paul's suggestion) look at decomposition of attributes effect on ideology - Done 
- Add Neural Networks to nuisance function estimation - Done 
- Work on prediction/nuisance visualizations - Done (although could do more)
- Add visualization for pure judge attributes - Done
- Add comments to all code - Done

If we run out of things to do:
Look at public mood data 


Completed tasks:

Ian
1. clean attributes dataset - Done!
2. merge ideology thing - Done! See Judge Attributes and Ideology.csv
3. clean carp manning - Done! See Carp Manning Clean.csv
4. merge carp and attributes - Done!

George
try finding a full dataset: by year and month + decisions of each judge - Done! 
upload the ideology thing - Done! 

after ian completes 2., george starts working on regression techniques + plotting of attributes and ideology
