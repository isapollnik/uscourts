Ian: 
- Explore prediction and/or ML econometric techniques with attributes + Carp Manning data

George:
- Hone predictive models of judge ideology (ie: deal with overfitting)
- (Paul's suggestion) look at decomposition of attributes effect on ideology (how much do attributes explain?)
- Add Neural Networks and maybe gradient Forest to nuisance function estimation 
- Work on prediction visualizations 

If we run out of things to do:
look at public mood data 
Completed tasks:
Ian
1. clean attributes dataset - Done!
2. merge ideology thing - Done! See Judge Attributes and Ideology.csv
3. clean carp manning - Done! See Carp Manning Clean.csv
4. merge carp and attributes - Done!

George
try finding a full dataset: by year and month + decisions of each judge - Done! 
upload the ideology thing - Done! 

after ian completes 2., george starts working on regression techniques + plotting of attributes and ideology
